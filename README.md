# VelocityBroadcast
VelocityBroadcast is a plugin that can send broadcast messages to the entire proxy network. This plugin supports an infinite amount of servers on a network and has an easy to read text format so users can read it as easily as possible.

## Information
This plugin is currently in the latest stable build and works as intended. If any bugs arise, please do not hesitate to let me know on discord. My username is adzelfirestar

## Commands
This plugin is as simple as can be. Usage is limited to one command right now, so it can be mastered by everyone.

The main command is /vbroadcast (or you can use the aliase /vb). Usage is as simple as /vb {message} (Make sure to give your admins the vb.broadcast permission)

## Future plans
Right now we only have two plans. You can suggest more though if you want to see a feature added. Just add a suggestion through the "Issues" menu above. I will take a look and see if it is a good idea to add the feature you want to see.

## Licensing
Please do not distribute my code as your own. Please do not rip my code and make a new plugin and claim it as your own. Please do not distribute my plugin jar or other files elsewhere. They are on github for a reason. If you want to suggest commits and help me make this plugin better, do so through the correct channels. Thank you.
