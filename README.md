# VelocityBroadcast-Pre-Release
The pre-release or "in progress" builds of our VelocityBroadcast Plugin. Bugs may show up and may be unstable. Config files may not carry over. So proceed with caution.

# Reporting bugs
Please use our issue tracker up top to submit bugs, issues, suggestions, and more. I do check those often. If you want to contribute, check out the CONTRIBUTE file in the file list.
